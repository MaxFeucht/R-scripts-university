# R scripts from university
These are some R scripts from recent university projects including my Bachelor Thesis, a logistic regression project, a project to practice multilevel data modelling and multilevel data analysis as well as the pretest and the final analysis of a direct replication of Hugenberg & Bodenhausen (2003).
